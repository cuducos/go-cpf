# Go CPF ![Tests](https://github.com/cuducos/go-cpf/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)

Three things about this repo:

1. I just started to learn [Go](https://golang.org/) with [_Learn Go With Tests_](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/) and this CPF (Brazilian unique identifier for the Federal Revenue) validation script is actually **my very first lines in Go** (except the ones from the book)
2. I'm sharing it here to get **feedback** ❤️
3. It's not a proper or usable package yet, I just expect **`go test`** to pass : )
